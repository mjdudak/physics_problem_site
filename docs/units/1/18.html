                <b>3.2.1)</b> You are a track runner,  running a relay. You are the second runner, and the first runner is running up to you at a speed of 9 m/s. By the time you enter the exchange zone (which is 20 m long), the first runner is 10 m behind you. What is the fastest you can run so that the first runner passes you the baton (meaning you are roughly in the same position) before you exit the exchange zone?

                <b>3.2.2)</b> You are trying to capture an epic high five on film. You get your two fastest friends, who can run at 8 m/s and 7 m/s, to run at each other to high five. In the frame of your shot, you can capture the two starting as far away as 100 m. However, you want them to meet exactly in the middle of the frame. If your faster friendstarts all the way on the right side of the frame, how far away should the slightly slower friend start?

                <b>3.2.3)</b> A coyote is chasing a squirrel, and starts 20 m away from the squirrel. The squirrel is trying to run toward a tree, which is 120 m away from the squirrel (away from the coyote). The coyote can run at 17 m/s. How fast must the squirrel run to be able to escape?

                <b>3.2.4)</b> You are driving on a country road when you encounter a slower car. You are travelling 25 m/s, they are travelling only 20 m/s. You are both driving Mazda 6&#39;s, which are 7 m long (use 7 m as &#34;one car length&#34;). When you are one car length behind the slow car, you start to pass it. You cannot move back into the other lane until you are a full two car lengths ahead of the slower car. The road switches to &#34;No Passing&#34; in 150 m. Do you make the pass before the road switches to &#34;No Passing&#34;? Justify your answer.

                <b>3.2.5)</b> Two warships are travelling in the same direction as each other. One, the USS Shiloh, is travelling at 14 m/s. The other, the USS Lake Erie, is travelling at 16 m/s. The USS Lake Erie starts 500 m away from the USS Shiloh. Onboard the USS Lake Erie is a t-shirt cannon. When the Lake Erie and the Shiloh are right alongside each other, they are separated by a distance of 100 m. The t-shirt cannon can launch at t-shirt at a speed of 25 m/s. First, how much time would it take for a t-shirt to travel from the Lake Erie to the Shiloh? Next, how long should the sailor shooting the t-shirt cannon wait between when the ships are 500 m away and when he shoots the t-shirt cannon so that the t-shirt lands on the Shiloh exactly as the fronts of the two ships are lined up?
